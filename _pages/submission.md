To facilitate a robust exchange of research and practical insights, we invite participants to submit short papers formatted according to the ACM double-column UbiComp-ISWC 2026 Proceedings. Submissions should address key aspects of reproducibility in ubiquitous and wearable computing research, including but not limited to: issues with reproducibility, open-source tools and datasets, position papers, challenges and considerations, and reproducibility case studies. We encourage submissions in one of the three formats:

- Position papers (2-4 pages, excluding references and appendices) presenting perspectives, challenges, or visionary ideas.
- Research proposals (2-4 pages, excluding references and appendices) outlining ongoing or planned research, including preliminary findings.
- Research Papers (4-6 pages, excluding references and appendices) presenting mature research findings or well-developed concepts. 


A peer review process will be conducted by the organizing committee. Each submission will undergo a single-blind review by one or two committee members. Authors are not required to anonymize their papers for submission. Following the individual reviews, the organizers will jointly select the accepted papers. All submissions will be managed through the Precision Conference System (PCS). Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library (DL) and the Adjunct Proceedings, ensuring a broad distribution of the workshop's contributions.
