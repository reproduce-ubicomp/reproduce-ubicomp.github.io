The reproducibility of research in wearable and ubiquitous computing is increasingly important as studies become more complex, relying on diverse sensors, datasets, and machine learning pipelines. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and tool developers to share methods, tools, and best practices that make UbiComp research more transparent, verifiable, and reusable.
Topics of interest:
The workshop will focus on, but is not limited to, anything related to improving the reproducibility of UbiComp research. This includes the following topics:

- Open-Source Tooling for Reproducible Pipelines
- Benchmark Datasets & Standardization (with focus on ease of use)
- Best Practices for methodological transparency
- Reproducible Machine Learning
- Tools for Data Sharing & Privacy-Preserving Reproducibility
- Open Hardware & Firmware Artifacts
- Infrastructure for Sharing Code, Data, and Experiments
- Case-Studies Showcasing (Un-)Successful Reproduction of Past Studies

We wish to encourage you to also submit your work, if your submission does not strictly fall under these topics, but you think it is relevant to the workshop scope.
